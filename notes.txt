The next set of grand challenges (VISIONS conference)

Generational computing

Problem of legacy data sets (Fortran, Cobol) esp in science
Climate change - backtest against models & data collected a long time
ago.  Need environment that might not have been explicitly recorded
(e.g. location of monitoring stations).  Want to apply modern
techniques - mapreduce over cobol?

Characteristics of a grand challenge
Diversity of solutions - cross-cutting across formal methods,
security, systems, social networking

Problem of lock-in - will facebook be around in 100 years time?  How
to get all of your stuff out?

Boom-bust cycle of centralization & decentralization
web hosting: tripod, geocities
email: individual servers, now hotmail, gmail
blogging - livejournal

what drives these moves?
ease of use - centralization
proliferation of competitors, desire for customization -
decentralization

alternate model: wave of innovation that converges on some solution;
then next wave

what will effect of platforms be - facebook API, etc.  Can we break
the cycle? f/b will still want to control consistent interface though

Previous work on storing data
Old manuscripts -> scan.  Still need to save originals though as may
contain information that can be revealed by future techniques (writing
in margins, on the back of pages)

Need to store data + code
e.g. Excel - migrating old data + formulas (environment)
Companies storing previous years' tax calculations & models
Excel formula language simple, declarative, extensible - but now
becoming more complex/brittle with vbscript

What to do about obsolete data formats?

Append-only data - object is pointer.  Only add fields (a la
inheritance).  gives a kind of version control

Can compress by replacing duplicates with pointers
Move to offline storage

eg. pictures - contain immutable metadata about camera.  layer edits
on top - crops, color adjustment, etc.  albums on top of that

Memoise intermediate transformations - can throw away if space needed,
can always reconstruct

Transformation language for filesystems

Building rome in a day - photos contain metadat which allow lens
curvature to be corrected later.  permitting future reuse.



old HTML rendering of archived web pages?
old mbox formats

provenance
copying sv. linking

Can facebook contain the whole world?

old tax models
lifestreaming

Archiving links, forms, search boxes on old websites (national
archives note on saved budget pages)
